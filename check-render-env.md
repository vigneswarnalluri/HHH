# üîç Check Render Environment Variables

The CORS issue might be caused by the `CLIENT_URL` environment variable in Render overriding our CORS configuration.

## Steps to Check:

1. **Go to Render Dashboard**
   - Visit: https://dashboard.render.com
   - Find your service: `hhh-1z4h`

2. **Check Environment Variables**
   - Click on your service
   - Go to **Environment** tab
   - Look for `CLIENT_URL` variable

3. **If CLIENT_URL is set to:**
   - `https://bharathcare.netlify.app` - This is causing the CORS issue
   - **Solution:** Delete or update this variable

4. **Update CLIENT_URL (if needed):**
   - Set it to: `https://bharathcare.netlify.app`
   - Or delete it entirely to use our new CORS configuration

5. **Redeploy Backend:**
   - After changing environment variables
   - Click "Manual Deploy" in Render dashboard
   - Wait for deployment to complete

## Alternative Quick Fix:

If you can't access Render dashboard, let me create a simpler CORS configuration that doesn't rely on environment variables.

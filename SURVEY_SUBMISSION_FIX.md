# ðŸ”§ Survey Submission Fix

## âœ… **Issue Fixed:**

The volunteer survey submission was failing with a 404 error because the volunteer components were using relative URLs instead of the full backend URL.

## ðŸ”§ **What I Fixed:**

1. **NewSurveyForm.js** - Updated to use `apiPost()` with proper base URL
2. **SurveyDashboard.js** - Updated to use `apiGet()` and `apiDelete()` with proper base URL
3. **API Utility** - Now automatically includes authentication tokens

## ðŸ§ª **How to Test:**

### **1. Survey Submission:**
1. Go to: https://bharathcare.netlify.app
2. Login with volunteer credentials
3. Go to "New Survey" form
4. Fill out the form and submit
5. Should work without 404 errors

### **2. Survey Dashboard:**
1. Go to volunteer dashboard
2. Click "My Surveys"
3. Should load surveys without errors
4. Delete functionality should work

### **3. Check Console:**
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Submit a survey
3. Should see success messages, not 404 errors

## ðŸŽ¯ **Expected Results:**

- âœ… **Survey submission works** - No more 404 errors
- âœ… **Survey dashboard loads** - Can view submitted surveys
- âœ… **Delete surveys works** - Can delete surveys
- âœ… **No CORS errors** - All API calls use proper base URL

## ðŸ”— **Your URLs:**
- **Frontend:** https://bharathcare.netlify.app
- **Backend:** https://hhh-1z4h.onrender.com

**The survey submission should now work perfectly!** ðŸš€

Wait 2-3 minutes for the deployment to complete, then test your survey submission.

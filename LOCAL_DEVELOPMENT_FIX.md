# 🔧 Local Development Fix

## 🚨 **Issue Identified:**
You're testing on `localhost:3000` but the backend is deployed on Render (`https://hhh-1z4h.onrender.com`). This causes a mismatch.

## ✅ **Solutions:**

### **Option 1: Test on Deployed Frontend (Recommended)**
1. **Go to**: https://bharathcare.netlify.app/donate
2. **Test donation form** - Should work with deployed backend
3. **Check console** - Should connect to Render backend

### **Option 2: Set Environment Variable for Local Development**
If you want to test locally:

1. **Create `.env` file** in the `client` directory:
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://hhh-1z4h.onrender.com
```

2. **Restart your local development server**:
```bash
cd client
npm start
```

### **Option 3: Run Local Backend**
If you want to test with local backend:

1. **Start local backend**:
```bash
cd server
npm start
```

2. **Keep default API URL** (localhost:5000)

## 🎯 **Recommended Approach:**

**Use the deployed frontend** at https://bharathcare.netlify.app/donate

**Why?**
- ✅ Backend is already deployed and working
- ✅ Database migration is applied
- ✅ All features are live
- ✅ No local setup needed

## 🔍 **Test Steps:**

1. **Visit**: https://bharathcare.netlify.app/donate
2. **Fill donation form** with test data
3. **Submit donation** - Should work without errors
4. **Check success modal** - Should show transaction details

## 📋 **Expected Results:**
- ✅ No "Internal server error"
- ✅ Success modal appears
- ✅ Transaction ID shown
- ✅ Admin dashboard shows donation

**The deployed version should work perfectly!** 🚀
